Safe innovation is always encouraged, but surprising the organizers with your brilliant exploitation of a loophole may cause your robot to be disqualified before it even competes.
3.	Each event has safety inspections. It is at their sole discretion that your robot is allowed to compete. As a builder you are obligated to disclose all operating principles and potential dangers to the inspection staff.
4.	Proper activation and deactivation of robots is critical. Robots must only be activated in the arena, testing areas, or with expressed consent of the event coordinators.
5.	All weapons must have a safety cover on any sharp edges.

6.	All participants build and operate robots at their own risk.
Combat
robotics is inherently dangerous. There is no amount of regulation that
can encompass all the dangers involved. Please take care to not
hurt
yourself or others when building, testing and competing. Any
kind of activity (repairing, battery handling, pneumatics systems etc.)
